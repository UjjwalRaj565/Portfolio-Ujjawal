This portfolio website is developed as part of a front-end development task during my training at Mantra Softech, where I am currently working as a Graduate Engineer Trainee. The task was assigned by our trainer, Anand Sir, and involved selecting a pre-designed HTML template and customizing it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to create a unique and personalized resume portfolio.
